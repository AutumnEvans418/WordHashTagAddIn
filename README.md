# WordHashTagAddIn
Converts hashtags in word docs into easily searchable paragraphs.

## How it works
This is VSTO Microsoft Word Add-in that allows you to use hash tags in your word document and track them using a nicely integrated UI.
All you have to do is add #hashtag to whatever paragraphs you want to tag.  Then everytime you save or refresh the tags, you'll see all
tags in your paper and be able to navigate to them.
